          "raw": "\nAmericans hate successful businesses. We verbally assault technology companies more than any other group.\nAmazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Twitter are the primary victims of public anger and acrimony.\nVenomous resentment toward them is not due to any specific action they’ve taken, but due to their **size and success**.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the most hated corporations are also the largest and most financially successful.\nRecent studies by the Pew Research Center highlight just how hostile we are. According to [data](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/27/how-americans-see-u-s-tech-companies-as-government-scrutiny-increases/) from 2020:\n\n- **72%** of adults say social media companies have too much power and influence in politics\n- **Half** of Americans (47%) say government should regulate major tech corporations _more_ than it does now\n- **64%** of Americans say social media have a _mostly negative_ effect on the way things are going in the country\n\nWhy is this a bad thing? Don’t we have a right to be concerned about people lying online? Haven’t social media sites made the country more polarized?\n\nI agree that we have _serious_ cultural problems. Americans are becoming increasingly aggressive towards each other.\nFewer and fewer people care about discussing ideas and would rather resort to name-calling, slander, and even to initiating violence.\n\nBut the problems we face are not a result of Big Tech’s supposed \"influence over us\" - they are a result of <span className=\"color-quinary-shade\"><b>bad philosophic ideas</b></span> that our society has accepted.\nThese problems are exacerbated by a corrupt and destructive public education system. Tech companies are not the problem. **American culture is.**\n \nOur focus is on software rather than on the disastrous ideas being spread by politicians, celebrities, and schools. Ideas make life better or worse, but no one cares to discuss them.\nTech companies and social media sites simply provide a platform by which we can communicate our ideas.\n\n<Callout>\nWhat we'll discuss:\n\n- Americans hate successful people and companies\n- Specific examples from political and cultural leaders\n- Tech companies make modern life possible\n- We should praise these corporations, not attack them\n</Callout>\n\nFirst, a quick note on how our culture views large tech businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\n## We hate wealthy tech companies\n\nIt’s hard to remember a time when the public loathed Bill Gates, but that was certainly the case during the 1990s.\nAs Microsoft rose to dominate the personal computing (PC) world, Gates began to receive increasing amounts of spite.\nMany began to accuse his company of being too large and influential in the PC sphere.\nThe U.S. government even [sued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.) Microsoft in 2001 for maintaining a \"monopoly\" in the PC market.\n\n<CalloutWithLabel title='✋ Hey, why did you put monopoly in quotes?' type='info'>\n  People use the word \"monopoly\" incorrectly. Monopolies are <em>impossible</em> without\n  government intervention. One of the biggest fallacies repeated today is that a free, unregulated\n  market will lead to the establishment of coercive monopolies.\n \n  In reality, every coercive monopoly was created because government gave special privileges to\n  existing companies that made entry exorbitantly expensive or altogether impossible.\n  Take government out of the economy, and we will never see another monopoly again.\n</CalloutWithLabel>\n\nIt wasn’t until Gates established the [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/) that his public image became favorable.\nAfter giving away his fortune and becoming a philanthropist, Americans began to love him. Gates was hated while earning his wealth, but loved while giving it away.\n\nThis is because Americans equate wealth with coercion, deception, and manipulation.\nMany believe that to build a successful and productive company, one must take shortcuts, steal ideas from others, or manipulate the public into buying their products.\n\nNot only is this notion patently false - it is destructive.\nA company can only become as massive as Amazon or Apple if it **offers products or services we love.**\nMicrosoft is not dragging people off the streets and forcing them to install Windows.\nFacebook is not holding anyone hostage and forcing them to create an account.\n\nIndividuals <u>choose</u> to buy the products and use the services tech companies offer because they make our lives better. Modern life is _impossible_ without Big Tech.\nSmartphones, laptops, tablets, and video streaming are some of the many tools built and provided by the corporations we condemn.\n\nRather than vilify tech companies, we should be _praising_ them. Our lives are far better and more enjoyable because they exist.\nBusinesses have the (relative) freedom to pursue profit - and customers benefit.\nBut despite their productivity, tech companies continue to endure abuse from political and cultural leaders.\n\n## Politicians and cultural leaders attack Big Tech\n\nAlthough Democrats and Republicans both engage in consistent attacks against Big Tech, much of the rhetoric originates from conservatives.\nThe fundamental issue is that **neither conservatives nor liberals believe in property rights.**\n\nPoliticians pay lip service to capitalism, to individual liberty, and to the right to keep property.\nBut the assault on tech companies reveals the true conviction of our leaders: once you reach a certain size, you become a public entity and your rights evaporate. What is that size? Who knows. No politician or leader specifically explains why a company’s size matters; they simply argue that a massive corporation **must** be evil.\n\nTed Cruz (R-TX) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) are two of the most well-known Republican senators. Both are heavy critics of tech companies, especially social media.\nDuring a recent hearing with social media CEOs, [Cruz slammed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NhYTm2auyw) Facebook and Twitter for what he believes is \"censorship\" of certain political ideas and for being politically biased.\nHawley [followed suit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBJx9kqa9bc) in condemning both platforms.\n\nHawley [railed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOdrPruSnrw) against these companies for \"secretly communicating\" with each other and for sharing information to conduct coordinated censorship against conservatives and to sway public opinion.\nHawley claims that this type of communication is immoral and reflects a concerted effort to suppress conservative voices on their platforms.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, tried to explain that his company communicates to others about \"security-related topics\" (timestamp 2:40 of the aforementioned video) such as terrorist attacks.\nThis allows Facebook to notify Twitter if there is suspected terrorist or sex-trafficking activity so that other large social media companies can be on high alert while moderating content.\n\nThis is a logical strategy considering the terabytes of data that are uploaded everyday. Coordination of this kind benefits users and makes social media sites safer.\nWe should welcome and appreciate cooperation between companies on issues like terrorism and sex-trafficking, so long as it does not involve violating a company’s agreement with its users (i.e. violating privacy policy).\n\nInstead, individuals like Hawley argue that tech companies are secretly meeting and sharing information so that they can simultaneously [shadow ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_banning) or censor posts made by Republicans.\nHe is not the only one claiming such malfeasance.\n\nBen Shapiro, popular conservative commentator, recently went on a [diatribe](https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/1348292928591032325) regarding the need for government oversight of tech companies who, he claims, are becoming monopolies. This tweet summarizes his view of social media platforms:\n\nShapiro begins by claiming he is \"anti-regulation\" then promptly argues for regulation in the next sentence! He and other pundits spend much time speaking about he supposed \"censorship\" of conservative posts on social media.\n\n\nAyn Rand explains the misconception of \"censorship\" in <u>The Virtue of Selfishness</u>:\n\n> \"Censorship\" is a term pertaining only to governmental action. No private action is censorship.\n> No private individual or agency can silence a man or suppress a publication; only the government can do so.\n> The freedom of speech of private individuals includes the right not to agree, not to listen and not to finance one’s own antagonists.\n\nUsers enter into an agreement with Twitter. If Twitter determines that a post violates the agreement, they can hide it or surround the tweet with a warning label.\nTwitter can not violate anyone’s free speech or First Amendment rights. Nobody has a right to tweet whatever they desire without repercussion.\nTwitter owns the platform and has the right to enforce their contractual agreements with its users.\n\nConservatives often cry out \"I have a right to my speech! I have a right to state my opinion!\" Not on Twitter; not on anyone else’s property without their consent.\n\nNo one has a right to go onto someone else’s platform and demand that platform to let them post at will.\nDoing so _violates the rights of the platform owner._ There is no difference in principle between forcing Twitter to let you post a comment and forcing a doctor to see you as a patient.\n\n**Initiating force is always wrong, regardless of context.**\n\nPeople and corporations alike have a right to conduct business with whoever they choose.\n\nTucker Carlson, popular conservative talk-show host, vehemently opposes Big Tech and is outspoken in his opinions regarding government’s role in regulating software and the internet.\nCarlson also fears automation and has repeatedly argued for governmental interference in that sphere.\n\nIn [this exchange](https://youtu.be/Bh8vqof9hAk?t=1740) with Shapiro (begin watching at 29:00 for relevant topic), Carlson is asked: \"Would you… be in favor of restrictions on the ability of trucking companies to use this sort of technology [autonomous trucks] to… maintain the number of jobs in the trucking industry?\"\nShapiro is asking whether or not Carlson recommends that the government limit or ban self-driving vehicles to keep truck drivers in business.\n\nCarlson responds emphatically \"Are you joking? In a second!\" He responds to the question in shock, almost implying that it would be silly to answer otherwise.\nFor Carlson, who claims to support capitalism, the government should protect blue-collar jobs, even if that requires intrusion into the market and the regulation of specific tech companies such as [Waymo](https://waymo.com/) and [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) (leaders of the self-driving vehicle market).\n\nTucker is no capitalist and no friend of private property. In fact, there is no difference **in essence** between how Tucker Carlson and someone like Bernie Sanders, who Carlson berates as a socialist, view the federal government.\nBoth believe that the government should control the economy - the only difference is in the implementation.\n\nMore and more conservatives are calling on federal agencies to crack down on Big Tech. Above all, they want government to:\n\n- _force_ tech companies to adopt neutral guidelines regarding political content (i.e. tech and social media companies cannot have a preference towards any specific idea/position on a political topic)\n- _break apart_ social media companies (especially Facebook and Twitter) into smaller pieces to avoid a \"monopoly\"\n\nEssentially, they want Big Tech to become a public domain like roads or water pipes.\n\nMatt Walsh, another popular conservative commentator, says on [episode 636](https://soundcloud.com/mattwalshshow/ep636) of his podcast (start listening at 1:10 for the relevant bits) \"instead of letting social media sites revoke your right to free speech…\"\n\nRead that quote again. Walsh claims that social media sites can \"revoke your right to free speech\".\nWait, Twitter can revoke my right to free speech?\nIn Matt’s opinion, yes.\nWhen Twitter removes or places a warning label on someone’s post, Matt believes Twitter is violating that user’s free speech.\n\n**Matt Walsh is disastrously wrong.** No private company has the ability to remove someone’s free speech right - it is **impossible.**\n\nUnfortunately, people like Walsh are using this piece of misinformation to try and persuade politicians to force new regulations upon Facebook and Twitter. Private property rights exist regardless of a person’s or company’s size and scope.\n\nJust as no one has the right to knock on your door and yell \"Let me in! I have to right to my body and my personal space so you must let me into your house!\" Your house is your property, and Twitter is the owner of its platform.\n\n_When Twitter bans one of Donald Trump’s tweets, that is not a violation of his First Amendment rights._\n\nThe First Amendment does not say \"everyone has a right to post on Twitter without repercussions.\"\nWhen you sign an agreement during the account creation process, that document determines your relationship with that service.\n\nIf a site determines that a specific post violates the agreement, _that is not a violation of any rights._\nUnfortunately, many Americans believe that it is in fact a violation of free speech.\n\nTech companies are private entities (although many people such as Shapiro and Walsh are trying to change that). They have a right to their property just as much as you have the right to your house or car.\nA platform’s size or scope does not determine whether or not it is a public entity.\n\nEven if Facebook maintained a 99% share of the social media market and 5 billion users, it **still** would not be a public service.\n\n## Tech companies seek user engagement\n\nA common misconception is that tech companies are communicating in secret to collectively force a specific set of ideas on its users.\nMost companies simply want to bring in more users into their network and entice current users to interact more with their product.\n\n\"But wait!\" Republicans will shout, \"Facebook and Twitter are obviously trying to coerce the public into becoming more liberal. They’re creating an echo chamber!\"\n\n**Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t care what your political views are.**\n\nHe and Facebook, along with every other major social media platform want the same thing: user engagement.\nLike all major corporations, the end goal of social media platforms is profit so that its employees and shareholders can eat and pay their bills.\n\nAdvertisement revenue is the primary form of income for many of these platforms. Ad revenue exists only if users are actively engaged in the product.\nIncreasing the number of users and the amount of engagement per user directly leads to an increase in profit for that platform.\n\nThe recipe is:\n\n1. Increase user engagement by recommending articles or items that a user will most likely enjoy (e.g. recommend a Fox News article to a Republican user)\n2. User enjoys their experience and subsequently opens the app more frequently and spends more time on the app\n3. Advertisers observe an increase in their own website activity as more users click on in-app advertisements\n4. Advertisers spend more money to increase their ad presence on the platform\n5. Facebook profits 💰\n6. Rinse and repeat\n\nThe profit motive has led to many new innovations such Facebook introducing its [news feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Feed) feature in 2006, which lead to an explosion in its popularity.\n\nWhen a company implements a new feature, updates their interface, or changes their privacy policy, people panic. They imagine hooded programmers working underground in a dark room watching them while trying to manipulate them.\nCompanies make these changes so that we, the users, will hopefully like the app and use it more.\n\n## Tech companies are not perfect\n\nWe ridicule and condemn tech companies far more often than they deserve, but they are not perfect.\nThere are a number of political positions they take that I disagree with. Silicon Valley often spends millions in support of Democratic party candidates.\n[Joe Biden](https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valley-opens-wallet-joe-biden/) received _~20x more_ money than Donald Trump did from major technology companies.\n\nYou can read my specific thoughts about both candidates here , but in short I consider both men immoral and ultimately **bad candidates** for this country (neither the Democratic or Republican party is interested in protecting individual rights).\nConsequently, I consider donations to either candidate misguided at best and morally wrong at worst.\n\nGoogle was developing a search engine in cooperation with the Chinese government called [Project Dragonfly](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(search_engine)>), though the project was recently terminated.\nThis custom search engine was indented to be compatible with China’s state censorship provisions. I do not believe that Google should cooperate and do business with evil regimes such as China’s government.\n\nDespite the massive number of potential search engine users living in China, Google <u>should not</u> sit down with China to make a tailor-made product to fit their rights-violating laws.\n\nThese are just some of the many decisions by Big Tech that I disagree with. But ultimately, these companies do far more good than bad.\n\n## Tech companies deserve reverence, not hatred\n\n**We should revere and praise Big Tech.** Instead, our political and cultural leaders have joined the rest of society in barraging these companies with venomous attacks.\n\nMost of what we see and hear regarding tech is negative. I hope that in the future more of us will defend these companies by explaining the wealth of amazing things they do and provide.\n\nBig Tech is our friend, not our enemy. Keep government out of their way, and these large companies will continue to produce goods and services that improve\nour lives.\n\n---\n\n**Update for Jan. 22nd, 2021**\n\nGoogle released a [blog post](https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/australia/8-facts-about-google-and-news-media-bargaining-code) today explaining their opposition to Australia’s proposed [legislation](https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/digital-platforms/news-media-bargaining-code) to further regulate digital platforms.\nGoogle is threatening to halt its search engine service in Australia if the bill, in its current form, passes. <u>I agree with Google.</u>\n\nThis law is an absolute abomination and will be impossible, if passed, to implement with any sort of objectivity. The proposed code focuses on a few things:\n\n- Forcing Google and other search engines to pay to show links to users\n- Forcing Google and other search engines to give news publishers (but not the average user) a 14 day notice of algorithm changes\n- Giving the Australian goverment the final say in arbitrating negotiations between search engines and other entities\n\nHow much does Google have to pay per link? Who knows. Will Google have to pay more for a New York Times link than for a link from a smaller site? I doubt any of bill’s authors know for sure.\n\nThis bill is a walking logical contradiction precisely becuase it is immoral in principle. _Australia has no moral authority to intervene into the operations and inner-workings of Google or any other digital platform._\nWe will keep track of this bill because it carries massive ramifications not only for Australia, but for the world. Governments in both Europe and America may follow with similar legislation in the future.\n\n---\n\n**Update for April 7th, 2021**\n\nThis week, the Supreme Court released a [document](https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/040521zor_3204.pdf) containing some opinions on pending cases. Of note is Justice Clarence Thomas’ writings on Big Tech (starting on page 9 of the document), specifically Twitter and its banning of Donald Trump’s account. Justice Thomas suggests that there is legal basis for imposing further regulations upon large tech platforms and/or taking legal action against Twitter for its recent actions (banning, flagging, etc.) regarding Trump and other user accounts.\n\nOn page 17, Thomas says \"legislatures might… be able to treat digital platforms like places of public accommodation.\" Like many conservatives, Thomas believes that once an entity becomes large enough, it becomes a \"public space\" and thus the federal government should assume a role in overseeing and/or moderating content. This notion is **immoral** and **destructive**. A private entity does _not_ become a public one simply due to its size or financial success. Federal and state governments have no moral right to assume control of any tech company, nor do they have the right to force those corporations to adopt certain user policies in the name of \"fairness\" or \"equality.\"\n\n---\n\n**Update for August 11, 2021**\n\nSenators have introduced yet another [anti-trust bill](https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-blackburn-and-klobuchar-introduce-bipartisan-antitrust-legislation-to-promote-app-store-competition) - this one targeting Google and Apple’s app stores. The bill claims that both companies are acting in an \"anti-competitive\" nature. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) says \"Big Tech giants are forcing their own app stores on users at the expense of innovative start-ups.\"\n\nThis is yet another example of Congress failing to understand property rights and punishing tech companies for being too large and too successful.\n",
